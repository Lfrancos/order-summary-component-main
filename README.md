## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was an interesting exercise, I still need to understand a couple of things.
>Right now to center things in the page I'm using "vh" units, and while it works I feel like when the height changes to much it is hard to keep the content of the container. So for example in this exercise if you make the window to little in height you will lose some of the elements inside.

This was a good opportunity to learn a little bit more about box-shadow. I had not used it that much and I took the time to understand a little more how it works.

### Continued development

I want to keep learning how to center something. I feel there may be a better way to do it than the way that I'm doing it.

The last exercise that I did the image that I added had some stretching when it was in a flex container. This time I was able to find a way around it. But I'm not sure if that is the best way to do it. Still need to practice that to see what is the best way to fix that.

### Useful resources
